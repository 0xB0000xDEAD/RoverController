# Rover Controller

## How it works
Sets up an AP, the Rover will connect to it if it's in range.
The Rover is controlled by sending joystick and switch state over either LoRa or a websocket.
The rover also sends telematics over the websocket to the controller, which then in turn is sent on to a connected phone.
